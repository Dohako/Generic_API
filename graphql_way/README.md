## Query examples

### First query

Show the number of impressions and clicks that occurred before the 1st of June 2017, broken down by channel and country, sorted by clicks in descending order. Hint:

``` sql
select channel, country, sum(impressions) as impressions, sum(clicks) as clicks 
from data 
where date < '2017-06-01' 
group by channel, country 
order by clicks desc;
```

```graphql
TBD
```

### Second query

Show the number of installs that occurred in May of 2017 on iOS, broken down by date, sorted by date in ascending order.

``` sql

group by date
order by date desc;
```

### Fourth query

where country = 'CA'
group by channel
order by CPI desc;
